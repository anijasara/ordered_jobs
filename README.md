A simple backend rails application which has a processor OrderedJobs (in lib/) that can be used to get the sequence of jobs from a single input string.

 Ruby version  - 2.6.3
 Rails version - 5.2.4

Manual

* Clone the repository
* Install gems with bundle install

* To run unit tests:

**  bundle exec rspec -> Included all possible specs for ordered_jobs sequence in /lib/ordered_jobs_spec.rb

Used array indexing and hash methods to get this done.

Cheers!
